## Sending events via HTTPs

The **AppendEvent** endpoint allows you to send an event to the server for processing. The endpoint is defined as a **POST** request and expects a JSON payload that follows the `EventInput` structure. Additionally, the URL includes a project identifier as a parameter.

### Endpoint URL

Replace `{projectid}` with your projects ID.

```
POST /api/{projectid}/event
```

### Request Format

**Request Headers**

- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **X-API-KEY:** `your-api-key` - Create a new api-key via the project settings.

**Request Body**

The endpoint accepts an array of events as payload. The payload should include the following fields:

- **eventType**: The type of event (e.g., `"user_signup"`).
- **distinctId**: A distinct identifier for the session. This can be connected to a person profile using an $identify event.
- **timestamp**: The time of the event occurring in ISO 8601 format.
- **properties**: A map of additional properties. This is stored as JSON and can be queried.

### Example

```json
[
  {
    "eventType": "user_signup",
    "distinctId": "unique_user_123",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-23T10:00:00Z",
    "properties": {
      "plan": "premium",
      "referrer": "google"
    }
  }
]
```
