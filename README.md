# This is _Quacklytics_ ðŸ¦†

_Quacklytics_ is an open-source analytics service built using **DuckDB** and designed to run analytical queries directly inside
your browser. It provides a seamless, lightweight, and high-performance way to process your data without the need for
expensive server-side compute resources.

## Features

**Browser-Based Analytics**: Perform analytics entirely in the browser.  
**High Performance**: Optimized for modern data processing needs.  
**Open Source**: Free to use and extend.  
**Easy to Deploy**: One Binary / Docker Image: No need to install or manage a database. All data is stored in simple files on your filesystem by leveraging sqlite and duckdb.

## Getting Started

Simply deploy the application using docker.  

Single binaries to run will be available at a later stage.

### Preparations (required for both methods)

You must create an empty configuration file called `application.conf` in your working directory.  

Simply run:
```shell
touch application.conf
```

This file will be populated with the default config on first start. 
If you want to modify the config before that, you can grab 
the [default config](backend/config/default.conf) from the git repo.

### Using Docker Compose
```yaml
services:
  quacklytics:
    image: ghcr.io/xz3dev/quacklytics/amd64:latest # arm64 or amd64
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    volumes:
      - data:/_data
      - tmp:/_tmp


volumes:
  data:
  tmp:
```

### Using Docker Run

```shell
docker run -d \
  -p 3001:3000 \
  -v data:/_data \
  -v tmp:/_tmp \
  --name quacklytics \
  ghcr.io/xz3dev/quacklytics/amd64:latest
```
